Implemented real-time text similarity matching by generating sentence embeddings. Used various algorithms, including TF-IDF, Average Word Embeddings, Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF), and BERT for generating sentence embeddings. Used Annoy as vector database to perform an approximate nearest neighbor search on vectors.
