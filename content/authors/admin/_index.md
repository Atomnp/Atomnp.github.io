I am a Machine Learning Engineer working remotely with Smart Data Solutions, a company based in Eagan, MN, focusing on AI-driven solutions for extracting information from healthcare documents like medical records and insurance claims. With a background as a Backend Engineer, I have extensive experience in building scalable APIs. I am dedicated to creating software that delivers meaningful value to its users.

As a curious and hardworking individual, I constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow, diving deep into complex problems and exploring innovative solutions. My collaborative nature makes me a strong team player who thrives in dynamic environments, fostering open communication and working closely with colleagues to achieve shared goals. Recently, I led the development and launch of EaseAnnotate, a project selected for the Microsoft for Startups program, which received funding and recognition from Microsoft. My passion lies in solving complex problems and building impactful software that drives real-world improvements
