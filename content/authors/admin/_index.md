I am a machine learning engineer at the Smart Data Solutions working on leveraging machine learning to extract information from healthcare documents including medical records and insurance claims. Previously, I have worked as backend engineer focused on building scalabale APIs for various services. I have experience acting as a team leader on mutiple projects. I also like to write blogs that cover in depth analysis of topics like programming and machine learning. I like to build software that creates value for someone who is using it. Recently I lead developement of software product named EaseAnnotate and launched it. The project was also selected for Microsoft for Startups program and got funding from microsoft.
